## General
Bingo is an open source package for performing symbolic regression, Though it 
can be used as a general purpose evolutionary optimization package.  

### Key Features
  * Integrated local optimization strategies
  * Parallel island evolution strategy implemented with mpi4py
  * Coevolution of fitness predictors
  
### Note
At this point the develop branch is significantly ahead of the master 
branch but will not be released officially until a larger proportion of the 
current master features are supported.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Bingo is intended for use with Python 3.x.  Bingo requires installation of a 
few dependencies which are relatively common for data science work in python:
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - mpi4py (if parallel implementations are to be run)
  - pytest (if the testing suite is to be run)
  
A requirements.txt file is included for easy installation of dependecies with 
pip or conda.

Installation with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Installation with conda:
```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

### BingoCpp
A section of bingo is written in c++ for increased performance.  In order to 
take advantage of this capability, the code must be compiled.  See the 
documentation in the bingocpp submodule for more information.

Note that bingo can be run without the bingocpp portion, it will just have lower 
performance.

If bingocpp has been properly installed, the following command should run 
without error.
```
python -c "import bingocpp"
```

A common error in the installation of bingocpp is that it must be built with 
the same version of python that will run your bingo scripts.  The easiest way 
to ensure consistent python versioning is to build and run in a Python 3 
virtual environment.

### Documentation
Sphynx is used for automatically generating API documentation for bingo. The 
most recent build of the documentation can be found in the repository at: 
doc/_build/html/index.html 


## Running Tests
An extensive unit test suite is included with bingo to help ensure proper 
installation. The tests can be run using pytest on the tests directory, e.g., 
by running:
``` 
pytest tests 
```
from the root directory of the repository.

## Usage Example
Currently, the best place to get started in bingo is by going through some 
examples.  The examples directory contains several python scripts and jupyter 
notebook examples of varying complexity.  The simplegp examples illustrate the 
very basics of symbolic regression in bingo, utilizing a simplified interface.  
More complex (and more efficient) examples can be found as well.
